StoneCold (2D Game and Engine)
==============================

About
-----

StoneCold is a top-down, 2D roguelike RPG and comes with its own SDL2 based Engine. 

It will be developed over the course of 2020, inspired by yahtzee (zero punctuation) who developed 12 games in 12 Month ... but im not that crazy so its just one game in 12 Months. Always intrigued by 2D/3D Graphic-Engines, i every now and then started developing my own, but either got bogged down in details or overwhelmed with possible features, so none ever made it out of prototype-status. But for 2020 the clear goal is to try again with a "Game (and architecture) first" approach. Which seems to be working way better than the old "Engine first!!1!", already.

The games concept is inspired by Diablo (Gameplay aspects), Action-RPGs just like Dark Souls (Gameplay aspects), Nuclear Throne (roguelike-ness and procedural map generation) and many more.

Using
-----

- C++ 17 (MSVC 14.24 VS2019)
- [SDL2 v2.0.10](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) : Cross-platform Graphics and IO library
- [SDL_image v2.0.5](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) : Loads images as SDL surfaces and textures
- [SDL_ttf v2.0.15](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) : Allows the use of TrueType fonts in SDL applications
- All the SDL/SDL_image/SDL_ttf dependencies

Architecture and Code Structure
-------------------------------

The code is written in an object oriented manner and simplicity (or rather: avoiding complexity) is a main goal. Fingers crossed.

As stated, my basic approach of "i want to build a Engine" has changed for this project and the game/gameplay itself has top priority. Engine reusability, common Render-API, etc. are therefore not factored in, when it comes to the core design. The result is a thighly coupled structure composed of four projects, that obviously still need a Engine, but its more as a necessity and not the sole focus:
- <b>StoneCold.Base:</b> Basic Settings, SDL2 includes, common Types and Enums, Math (Vec2) classes
- <b>StoneCold.Engine:</b> ECS, Game-State management, Event handling, Collision detection, etc.
- <b>StoneCold.Game:</b> Window creation, Main-Loop and the "SimulationManager" to setup Levels, NPCs, Menus, etc.
- <b>StoneCold.Resources:</b> Resource management with Lifetime checks (loading and unloading) and unique Resources

The Engines core building blocks are the Entity–component–system (ECS) and the Game-State management.

Some of the Textures are hand drawn (thanks MS Paint and Gimp) but the nice looking ones are created by actual Artists:
